We have different types of teeth, like incisors and molars, that have unique shapes for biting, tearing, or grinding food.","The tongue is a strong, flexible muscle in your mouth that helps with tasting, chewing, and swallowing food. It has tiny bumps called taste buds that detect flavors like sweet, salty, sour, and bitter. The tongue also helps us speak clearly by shaping sounds into words.","Lips are soft, flexible edges of the mouth that help us eat, speak, and express emotions. They protect the mouth and are sensitive, allowing us to feel textures and temperatures.

It allows your arm to bend and straighten, helping you perform actions like lifting, throwing, and reaching. The elbow works with muscles and bones to give your arm flexibility and strength.","The knee is the joint in the middle of your leg that connects the thigh to the lower leg. It allows your leg to bend and straighten, making movements like walking, running, and jumping possible. The knee joint is supported by strong ligaments and muscles, giving stability and strength to your leg.","Toes are the small digits at the front of your feet that help with balance and movement.
