He walks to the kitchen and gets some eggs. He takes some oil and puts a pan on the stove. Next, he turns on the heat and pours the oil into the pan. He cracks the eggs into a bowl, mixes them, and then pours them into the hot pan. He waits while the eggs cook.\nThey cook for two minutes.\nNext, Tom puts the eggs on a plate and places the plate on the dining room table. Tom feels happy because he cooked eggs.
